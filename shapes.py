        lists from pyglet.graphics.vertex_list(), then draw them with pyglet
        rendering. Refer to the pyglet.shapes module for more information.

        A shape should not need an update function. Instead, put all of the
        properties as function-defined ones. This saves time and GPU. Also,
        instead of having x and y properties seperately, use a Point or a
        Pointlist. These are much faster performance-wise and more neater.

        A shape should look like one from the pyglet.shapes module, but should
        be drawn with pyglet rendering. It should subclass a widget or a shape,
        but that is not necessary. If you do, however, keep in mind that the
        events of a widget will be dispatched, like draw and update. You can
        also add the shape's vertex list to a pyglet.graphics.Batch() for
        faster performance and draw the batch instead of drawing the vertex
        list.

        You can use pyglet rendering like this:

        with arcade.get_window().ctx.pyglet_rendering():
            # Do something

        Alternatively the arcade.get_window() part can be replaced with the

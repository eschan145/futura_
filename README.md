# futura

Futura is a GUI toolkit and extension for the Python Arcade library. It can be minimlly modified to work with Pyglet.

Futura was created for a smooth and modern GUI toolkit for the Python Arcade library. The code can be minimally adapted for work with pure Pyglet. You can create and modify themes for customization, or just use the default, existing one. There are a vast amount of features for each widget, though few of them are shown in the examples.

More than meets the eye in the examples. To see all features, look at the source code of each widget. This includes several different types of interactive widgets and various shapes. It also includes API for creating your own widgets, which are quite easy to do. Everything is object-oriented, which aids in accessing properties and setting them. These built-in widgets have plenty of documentation and functions.

Several widgets are provided to use. These include `Image`, `Label`, `Button`, `Slider`, `Toggle`, `Entry`, and various shapes. Like most projects based off Pyglet, in this GUI toolkit, all widgets subclass a base widget class, which dispatches events to them. More widgets are going to be added in the near future, like `Combobox` and `Listbox`. You can mess with Pyglet directly for more features. Post issues int the [Issues](https://github.com/eschan145/futura/issues) tab, or comment on ones existing.

Themes can be modified or created for additional styling.

This is based on the [`pyglet`](https://pyglet.org/) and [`arcade`](https://arcade.academy/) libraries, which are still active and working today.

Contributions are welcome.
